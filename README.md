BAGUAL is a patchwork of code from here and there knitted
together in order to attempt to get a somewhat functional
IA-32 kernel for study purposes mainly. If it resembles
very early linux kernels it's because most of its bits
came from there, but there are parts of other small
projects around as well.
There is no roadmap for BAGUAL, as it's sort of a spare
weekend time project. Any contribution is welcome.

To start playing with it (it does not do anything
interesting at the moment besides booting and catching
interrupts) go ahead and hit 'make test-run' once the VM
is up and running try keyboard combinations such as CTRL+C or CTRL+X.
